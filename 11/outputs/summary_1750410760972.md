A 25-year-old man presents with a sharp chest pain localized over his heart, lasting a few seconds, typically worsened by coughing or lying down, and relieved by leaning forward. The pain began three days ago, occurs intermittently, and sometimes radiates to his neck. He has no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other systemic complaints. He recently recovered from the flu. He is otherwise healthy with no past medical history, medications, allergies, or surgeries. His father recently died of a heart attack two weeks ago, which is causing him significant anxiety. The patient occasionally drinks alcohol but does not smoke or use recreational drugs. Examination and further testing including an ECG and possibly blood work are planned to evaluate his condition, and reassurance was provided to reduce his worry.
